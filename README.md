# Song Tube
This is a web application that takes a video from the youtube and provides controls such as loops, playback speed, and position (TBA). There is no way to create loops in youtube video designed for practicing sections of a song repeatedly.

## Getting Started
Take a youtube format `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ` for example. This site can only accept this style of format as of the moment. 

Pressing the `Now` buttons on the side of the text field of Loop Start and End would get the current time the video is playing. 

Playback speeds would change the current playback rate of the video. You can statically choose `0.5x` `0.75x`, and `1x` and soon we can customize the playback rate to your desired choice.

Position is just skipping the video by either `-5` or `+5` seconds. You can also use the `left` and `right` arrow keys.

Play/Pause button would just play or pause the button. You can also use the `spacebar` key. 

## To improve
> I would soon add the ability to take sections of the song and position the current time to each section
> I would soon add databases where you can jump through multiple songs and have your sections saved through your database.
